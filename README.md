## BIL
#### Inititially BIL was to mean "Building Interogation Language" but at this point its just a name and its easy to remember...

### What is it?
A schema and some tooling to interpret the schema to save and define building programs and requirements

### Goal; 

To “objectify” the process of defining requirements for buildings. This is to enable the computation of this data as a means to define needs and evaluate the ability for a particular design or existing facility to satisfy those needs.

### Main thoughts and ideas

Building Programs are most done in tools like Excel.  Excel tends to be a great tool for this as in their most simple form a building program is certainly a list of required spaces and areas associated with them.  This approach is great unless you want to do any of the following;

1. Make a building program and its drivers easy to understand
2. Manage diffrent types of objects in a program
  * Space and Things that take up space
  * Space and Area that is derived from other spaces or objects
  * ...
3. Interact with with a building program as objects and easily associate those objects to one another for later use
4. Compare programs at a logical level vs at a "outcome" level
5. Directly link requirements in a program to a a hypothetical spatial structure and a designs proposed physcial structure
6. ...
